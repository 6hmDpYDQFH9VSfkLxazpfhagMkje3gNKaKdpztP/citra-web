# Citra Official Website

This repository contains the source for the [Citra Emulator](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra) website, which can be found at https://citra-emu.org/.

## Quick Start

### Required Tools
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) (Install this using the command `npm install -g gulp`, with root / admin permissions.)
- [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org)
- [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)

### Instructions
1. Open up a terminal or command prompt in the `citra-web` directory.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp`.

Now, Gulp should have built the Citra website, and hosted it locally. It will print out the `Access URL`s, which you can go to in your browser to view it.

## Sitemap

The sitemap for the Citra website can be found in [SITEMAP.md](SITEMAP.md).
